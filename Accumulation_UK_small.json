The reef is 15km long by 6km wide and clearly defined on 2D and 3D seismic and builds to more than 200m above the surrounding Z2 (Hauptdolomite) platform.\nShell has hit gas at the Pensacola exploration well in the UK southern North Sea and intends to proceed with a flow testing programme on the well.\n\nJoint venture partner Deltic Energy said in a brief update that Pensacola had encountered gas in the reservoir and Shell had recommended that a full well testing programme be done to evaluate the commerciality of the prospect and update the geological model.\n\nThe Pensacola prospect may contain up to 982 BCF of gas initially in place with an estimated gross P50 recoverable resource of 309 BCF.  A number of potential commercialisation options exist via the existing Breagh infrastructure or a new pipeline to Teesside.\n\nGas has already been proven in the Zechstein on the block in the three wells drilled to test the Lytham-Fairhaven structure and the overlying anhydrite encases the reef providing a near-perfect seal.\n\nThis prospect will be showcased at PROSPEX 2019.\n\nSimilar Zechstein reef structures produce hydrocarbons in Poland, Netherlands and western Canada but are effectively untested in the UKCS with the exception of the nearby Crosgan well which successfully flow gas to surface from a similar reefal structure.

Egdon acquired the then shut-in field from Roc Oil GB Limited in March 2007 for £250,000.  Production was restarted in June 2007 and production currently averages around 50 barrels of oil per day. To date, the field has produced a total of over 192,000 barrels of oil, which represents only a small percentage of the mapped oil in place, which Egdon estimates could total over 4 million barrels. The field has potential for additional drilling to increase the current production levels and total field recovery.  Planning consent is already in place for an additional well and a decision on the timing and bottom hole location of this will be made during the first half of 2009 once reprocessing of the existing 3D seismic data has been completed and fully evaluated.  In the meantime the previously free-flowing Keddington-2y well is currently being completed for pumped production which is anticipated to increase total field production.  Egdon continues to evaluate options for utilising the associated gas production for electricity generation for both site use and for sale and will be progressing decisions in this area during the next few months.","discovery_year":1997,"hydrocarbon_type":"OIL","mps_created_time":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","mps_datasource_tags":"Data derived from UK OGA (https://data-ogauthority.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/oga-onshore-fields-wgs84)","mps_est_area_sqkm":7.31306485921566,"mps_est_elevation_max_m":28,"mps_est_elevation_min_m":15,"mps_est_shore_status":"ONSHORE","mps_project_tag":null,"mps_uuid":"1b9176fc-9de8-4612-a034-6e8c83c3913c","updt":"2023-01-03T09:08:12.047Z"},"id":"mps_mapping_accumulation.1b9176fc-9de8-4612-a034-6e8c83c3913c"},

It will be able to store up to a gigaton of carbon dioxide - the equivalent of three years’ worth of current UK CO₂ emissions. It could initially store above 5MTPA of CO₂, scaling in time to 25MTPA. The MNZ Cluster will be able to accept CO₂ transported by pipeline, ship and rail. First injection could come as soon as 2028. The company currently plans to develop Bains for gas storage through the drilling of new wells, and estimates a storage capacity equivalent to three to four days’ supply for the UK. Further regulatory approvals are required before gas storage operations can commence. South Morecambe field has 5 times the amount of total CO2 storage potential as North Morecambe field, thus an assumption has been made that injection rates for South Morecambe are scaled at 4-5 times that of North Morecambe.","discovery_year":null,"hydrocarbon_type":null,"mps_created_time":"2023-09-20T21:41:12.900Z","mps_datasource_tags":"Data derived from BGS report (https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/archive/hub/publications/160548/industrial-carbon-dioxide-emissions-carbon-dioxide-storage-potential-uk.pdf).

These high-quality geological stores represent the most geographically proximal offshore storage sites to Humberside, the UK’s largest industrial cluster, and are directly connected by pipeline to the PUK-operated onshore Dimlington Gas Terminal.\n\nOrion is expected to play a crucial role in providing additional, cost-effective CO2 transport and storage services to various industrial and power generation emitters across the broader Humberside area. The project is planned to be operational by 2031, with initial CO2 injection rates of 1 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), ramping up to over 6 Mtpa. CCL is looking forward to supporting Perenco as they advance this important project towards final investment decision, ultimately aiming for first CO2 injection by 2031.","discovery_year":null,"hydrocarbon_type":null,"mps_created_time":"2023-09-21T08:38:19.653Z","mps_datasource_tags":"Data derived from Carbon Catalyst (https://www.ogv.energy/news-item/carbon-catalyst-receives-two-licence-awardsfor-itsorion-carbon-capture-and-storage-ccs-project).

This means that rather than going through the local authority like most planning applications, the KGSP required a Development Consent Order (DCO) from the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). This was granted in March 2017.\n\nWe are now looking to amend the existing DCO to give the option of storing hydrogen rather than natural gas.

The facility could be storing low-carbon hydrogen as early as 2028.\n\nThe existing Aldbrough Gas Storage facility, which was commissioned in 2011, is co-owned by SSE Thermal and Equinor, and consists of nine underground salt caverns, each roughly the size of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Upgrading the site to store hydrogen would involve converting the existing caverns or creating new purpose-built caverns to store the low-carbon fuel.\n\nWith an initial expected capacity of at least 320GWh, Aldbrough Hydrogen Storage would be significantly larger than any hydrogen storage facility in operation in the world today. The Aldbrough site is ideally located to store the low-carbon hydrogen set to be produced and used in the Humber region.\n\nHydrogen storage will be vital in creating a large-scale hydrogen economy in the UK and balancing the overall energy system by providing back up where large proportions of energy are produced from renewable power. As increasing amounts of hydrogen are produced both from offshore wind power, known as ‘green hydrogen’, and from natural gas with carbon capture and storage, known as ‘blue hydrogen’, facilities such as Aldbrough will provide storage for low-carbon energy.","discovery_year":null,"hydrocarbon_type":null,"mps_created_time":"2023-05-25T15:20:45.347Z","mps_datasource_tags":"Data derived from SSE Thermal (https://www.ssethermal.com/news-and-views/2021/07/plans-for-world-leading-hydrogen-storage-facility-at-aldbrough/).

These high-quality geological stores represent the most geographically proximal offshore storage sites to Humberside, the UK’s largest industrial cluster, and are directly connected by pipeline to the PUK-operated onshore Dimlington Gas Terminal.\n\nOrion is expected to play a crucial role in providing additional, cost-effective CO2 transport and storage services to various industrial and power generation emitters across the broader Humberside area. The project is planned to be operational by 2031, with initial CO2 injection rates of 1 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), ramping up to over 6 Mtpa. CCL is looking forward to supporting Perenco as they advance this important project towards final investment decision, ultimately aiming for first CO2 injection by 2031.","discovery_year":null,"hydrocarbon_type":null,"mps_created_time":"2023-08-23T07:51:56.549Z","mps_datasource_tags":"Data derived from Carbon Catalyst (https://www.ogv.energy/news-item/carbon-catalyst-receives-two-licence-awardsfor-itsorion-carbon-capture-and-storage-ccs-project).

The oil will be extracted from the Mexborough Rock, which is a conventional sandstone reservoir that has produced oil for the existing Glentworth-K site for 60 years. The new wellsite will produce oil for up for 21 years and will include a well pad for the drilling of an appraisal well and up to seven horizontal development wells.\n\nThe proposed development will operate in a similar manner to the existing Glentworth-K wellsite and will be carried out in phases.\n\nThe planning application has been submitted to Lincolnshire County Council for the installation of the well pad and wells for the extraction of oil. The oil produced at the site will be sold to a domestic refinery. Phase I has the potential to add c.200 bbls/d and development of c.1.0 mmstb 2P reserves (currently 2P undeveloped). If phase I is successful, this will be followed by further development drilling in subsequent years with the subsequent development having the potential to add an additional 500bbls/d and the addition of c.2mmstb 2P reserves from 2C.  Phase I of the project has a mid-case NPV of £17.5 million.","discovery_year":1961,"hydrocarbon_type":"OIL","mps_created_time":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","mps_datasource_tags":"Data derived from UK OGA (https://data-ogauthority.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/oga-onshore-fields-wgs84)","mps_est_area_sqkm":1.75655153735666,"mps_est_elevation_max_m":25,"mps_est_elevation_min_m":18,"mps_est_shore_status":"ONSHORE","mps_project_tag":null,"mps_uuid":"cbf1a1e1-ce91-4f21-a0a4-4b7e6e721505","updt":"2023-05-10T08:07:27.238Z"},"id":"mps_mapping_accumulation.cbf1a1e1-ce91-4f21-a0a4-4b7e6e721505"},

Computed residual oil saturations in this reservoir are supported by the observed oil and gas shows. The 23/26-17 well penetration is interpreted to lie a short distance below the base of a retreated hydrocarbon column. This interpretation is based on close analogy with a number of similar CNS diapir flank fields which have residual oil zones of 30m to 120m thickness immediately below the oil-water-contact. Here, existing hydrocarbon columns appear to have retreated due to minor trap leakage, although structural tilting, hydrodynamics and late pore pressure increase may also be contributory factors. The Isolde prospect is surrounded by large oil and gas fields in the target Chalk Group and Palaeocene sandstone reservoirs.  Potential recoverable resources are in line with the average of the analogous fields, split approximately 80:20 between the chalk and sandstone reservoirs. Chance of exploration success is appreciably better than 1 in 2, reflecting both the 100% success ratio of this trap type in the study area and the close proximity of similar, large fields.","discovery_year":1992,"hydrocarbon_type":"OIL","mps_created_time":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","mps_datasource_tags":"MapStand various sources - Contact MapStand Support for more details","mps_est_area_sqkm":4.22093602300227,"mps_est_elevation_max_m":-78,"mps_est_elevation_min_m":-85,"mps_est_shore_status":"OFFSHORE","mps_project_tag":null,"mps_uuid":"ae355970-be2c-4b3c-be61-0927fabbd86e","updt":"2022-02-03T12:33:33.978Z"},"id":"mps_mapping_accumulation.ae355970-be2c-4b3c-be61-0927fabbd86e"},

If the initial test is successful, we will drill and test a horizontal sidetrack, Loxley-1z, within the Portland and carry out an EWT to establish commercial viability. Post period, in November 2019, UKOG submitted a planning application to extend the existing Broadford Bridge planning approval by 24 months to March 2022. Also post period, OGA approved an amendment to the PEDL234 Retention Area work programme, wherein Loxley-1 is to be drilled by December 2021.","discovery_year":1983,"hydrocarbon_type":"GAS","mps_created_time":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","mps_datasource_tags":"MapStand various sources - Contact MapStand Support for more details and UKOG website - https://www.ukogplc.com/page.php?pID=127","mps_est_area_sqkm":14.658520885571,"mps_est_elevation_max_m":74,"mps_est_elevation_min_m":42,"mps_est_shore_status":"ONSHORE","mps_project_tag":null,"mps_uuid":"f1bf3fff-b31b-4d36-a1b8-62a183c0e9b6","updt":"2022-06-08T11:20:12.037Z"},"id":"mps_mapping_accumulation.f1bf3fff-b31b-4d36-a1b8-62a183c0e9b6"},

Storage and production of hydrogen. Construction of up to 43 bcf (1.2 bcm) of hydrogen-ready salt cavern storage. For context, if this capacity is ultimately achieved it would materially increase the UK’s current reported 61 bcf (1.7 bcm) total working underground gas storage capacity. The envisaged hydrogen-ready build also means the site could hold either hydrogen or natural gas from operational inception;\nSalt cavern storage would be linked to the national pipeline transmission system (“NTS”) via a new planned hydrogen-ready pipeline. As per the prior 2008 project, the new pipeline would be designed with an envisaged capacity designed to be capable of handling up to 1 bcf/day (28 million m³/day). For context, this throughput capacity, if achieved, would equate to approximately one seventh (14%) of current estimated UK daily natural gas consumption;",

This natural gas storage facility has been in operation since 1975 and is one of the largest pore storage facilities in Germany with its 0.8 billion m³ storage volume in 1,500m deep sandstone layers.The HyStorage research project aims to investigate the influence of hydrogen on porous rock formations in order to determine the feasibility and integrity of pore storage facilities for the storage of hydrogen. For this purpose, a specialized gas-technical unit for the storage test was set up on a designated drilling site at Uniper Energy Storage's Bierwang site. Commissioning is currently in progress and first hydrogen will be injected from September 2023 onwards. The storage test intends to inject different methane-hydrogen gas mixtures with 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 25 per cent hydrogen content in the natural gas into a smaller former natural gas reservoir in three operating phases and to withdraw it again after a standstill period of about three months. The storage horizon is independent of the existing Bierwang natural gas storage facility. ",

                "description": "A 354-kilometre oil pipeline transports oil and NGL from Ekofisk to the Teesside Terminal. The terminal also receives production from J-Block and other third party volumes from other areas of the North Sea.\n\nConocoPhillips operates the Teesside terminal. Oil was first received in 1975, and the main processing plant was completed in 1979. The facility was originally designed as a one million barrels/day crude oil reception, processing, storage and trans-shipment installation. The terminal also fractionates natural gas liquids into ethane, propane and butane, Operations comprise both processing and tanker-loading facilities covering a 285-acre site at Seal Sands, at the mouth of the River Tees, Middlesbrough.\n\nThe plant includes a stabilization section, an NGL section, utilities section, crude oil and NGL storage tanks and a port of shipment. The oil and NGL from the Norpipe pipeline is fractionated, to reduce the vapor pressure of the crude oil, in the stabilization process. The stabilized crude oil is stored, ready for shipment, at the tank farm which comprises nine storage tanks each of 750,000 barrel capacity. The NGL is separated into methane, ethane, propane and butane, with capacity to also separate normal-butane, and iso-butane in the NGL section. Methane is used as fuel for the plant. Ethane and butane are cooled to liquid state and stored refrigerated in large insulated tanks prior to shipment. Propane is currently directly loaded to ship. From 2019 pipeline export of propane will be available and in 2020 new pressurised storage for ship loading will be available.\n\nCrude oil and natural gas liquids from the J-Block and Greater Ekofisk Area fields are delivered to Teesside as well as third party volumes from other areas of the North Sea. The suitability for deep-water quay facilities was one of the reasons why Teesside was chosen as the terminal site for Ekofisk production. The terminal has four quays for crude oil (three currently in service), one of which can also load NGL products, and three dedicated quays for NGL products. The crude oil quays can receive tankers of up to 150,000 tonnes d.w. and two of the NGL quays can receive ships up to 60,000 cubic-meters capacity for some products.",

They aim to have the terminal operational in 2027. Fluxys and the Advario terminals are now engaging with major industrial operators and energy suppliers to introduce their project.\n\nIdeally located in the heart of Europe, at Belgium's Port of Antwerp-Bruges, the future terminal will deliver storage and multimodal sendout solutions for ammonia (train, truck, barge and possibly ammonia pipelines connected to local industrial sites), while optionally also providing facilities to convert ammonia back into hydrogen. The terminal will also connect to the Fluxys open-access hydrogen network to ensure supply throughout northwest Europe.",

A particular feature here is the industrial scalability of the underground storage facilities and surface facilities at the Etzel cavern site. \n\nIn this context, the Etzel pipeline and grid hub in particular offers a wide range of cooperation and funding opportunities for the development of an H2 economy in the Friesland / Ostfriesland / Wilhelmshaven region in northwestern Germany.\n\nExpansion opportunities are also offered by the integration of power generation through offshore wind energy, the cross-border pipeline connection of Etzel to the Netherlands as well as the possible import of H2 by ship via an H2 terminal at the deep water port in nearby Wilhelmshaven.\nConnection to supra-regional gas pipelines is available; these can be converted to H2\n\nSince 2007, the STORAG ​​E TZEL cavern facility has developed into one of the largest oil and gas storage sites in Europe. In addition to the 75 caverns that currently exist (as of 2022), further storage cavities can be created in the Etzel salt dome. There is potential for expansion to 99 cavern locations. A considerable part of the total volume of all German crude oil and natural gas reserves is already stored in Etzel. Oil storage capacity at Etzel site currently available: 5.0 million m3.",

Situated at Nether Broadmuir, a mile (1.4 km) west southwest of Whinnyfold in Aberdeenshire, Cruden Bay Booster Station represents the first of four shore-based pumping stations which send an oil and liquified gas mixture through the Forties Pipeline System after it makes landfall at Cruden Bay. Built by BP and bought by INEOS in 2017, this pipeline system represents the largest offshore oil-gathering network in the world.\n\nAt the Cruden Bay Booster Station, oil is mixed with liquified gas from the St. Fergus Gas Terminal. The combined product is pumped south through an underground pipeline to Kinneil Terminal near Grangemouth, via further booster pumping stations at Netherley, Brechin and Balbeggie. This 130-mile / 209-km long pipeline is 91cm (36 inch) in diameter and was commissioned in 1975. On reaching Kinneil Terminal, the products are then separated for processing.\n\n",

Global commodities trading company, Trafigura, is to reopen the Teesside LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal.\n\nTrafigura have taken on the lease for the site from PD Ports and expect to invest around $30m, which will boost UK energy security and reduce reliance on imported Russian gas. It aims to open in mid-2018.\n\nThe terminal will accept floating storage and re-gasification units (FSRU), allowing Trafigura to avoid around $1bn in costs associated with building a new LNG import terminal.\n\nThe terminal was previously opened and operated by Excelerate Energy and mothballed since 2015.\n\nThe move comes as the UK relies more and more heavily on imported gas supplies. One FSRU can supply around 5% of UK gas needs for up to a week.",

It’s a multimodal port, whose focus is on inland navigation. North Sea Port is a European top port that stretches over more than 60 kilometres and two countries, Belgium and the Netherlands. The cross-border port known as North Sea Port was founded on 1 January 2018 and is the result of a merger between the Dutch Zeeland Seaports (Vlissingen and Terneuzen) and the Flemish/Belgian port of Ghent. North Sea Port has eight public shareholders. On the Dutch side of the border they are the province of Zeeland (25%) and Borssele, Terneuzen and Vlissingen municipalities (8.33% each). On the Flemish side, they are the city of Ghent (48.52%), the municipalities of Evergem (0.03%) and Zelzate (0.005%) and the province of East Flanders (1.444%). The shareholders are involved and informed by means of a shareholders’ committee. It contains representatives of the municipal councils, the Dutch councils and executives and the provincial councils. In addition, there are ongoing structural and bilateral consultations with the shareholders.",

This joint development agreement is an important step towards the development of a green ammonia import and distribution infrastructure in the Port of Hamburg. \n\nTargeted to provide hydrogen to Germany in 2026, the planned import terminal is to be located at Mabanaft’s existing tank terminal in the Port. This location offers strategic access to green ammonia from large-scale green hydrogen production facilities operated by Air Products and its partners around the world. The intention is to convert the ammonia to green hydrogen via Air Products’ facilities in Hamburg, before distributing it to buyers locally and across northern Germany. This plan responds to the accelerating demand for clean energy to meet climate objectives and the need to diversify energy sources.",

The Aramis launching phase will focus on:\n• A new receiving shipping terminal (~3 Mtpa): liquid CO2 will be transported by coaster/barge from different industrial clusters located in the region to a new receiving terminal and temporary storage in an onshore hub located at the Maasvlakte near Rotterdam. \n• A compressor station (~2 Mtpa): Compressed (gas phase) CO2 volumes coming by onshore pipeline from Rotterdam and its hinterlands will be further compressed in a compressor station and combined with the above-mentioned liquid CO2 for transport through a new high-pressure, ambient temperature offshore trunkline to the receiving offshore platforms. \n• An offshore trunkline (150-200km): The Aramis Project envisages a new high-capacity trunkline (>20Mtpa) to transport the compressed and cryogenic CO2 from the receiving terminal and compressor station to the geological storage sites, located in the offshore K&L blocks. Further, an offshore tie-in to connect third-party infrastructure (Athos) from IJmuiden will be designed and developed.\n• An offshore interfield pipeline network: Once the CO2 reaches the central platforms in the K&L blocks it will be injected through wells that connect to the geological sinks located at 3-4km depth. The system can be expanded by distributing CO2 to other nearby facilities through a network of interfield pipelines (new and/or re-use of existing gas pipelines are being investigated) to cater to the expected increase in demand for geological storage. \n\nOperators: Aramis CCS C.V.",

It is proposed that a permanently moored Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) will be installed around 37 kilometres offshore of the coastline of Fylde, North West England. The FSRU will be moored by means of a submerged unloading buoy system. Once operational, LNG cargo will be pumped to the FSRU via Ship‐to‐Ship Transfer, regasified, and exported via a new pipeline system for entry into the National Grid Gas, National Transmission System (NTS) onshore at Barrow‐in‐Furness in Cumbria.\n\nOnshore elements of the projects have been granted planning permission by the local planning authority (Barrow Borough Council) under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990;\n\nAll major offshore permits have been obtained, approved ‘in principle’, or are in the final stages of being obtained. \n\nThe FSRU is sized for 170,000 cubic metres  whilst a larger vessel (up to 210,000 cubic meters) can be considered during final commercial discussions.  The Port Meridian pipeline and the connected land facilities are capable of a maximum daily throughput rate of 1250 mmscfd. However, the base case design is for a maximum daily throughput rate of 750 mmscfd.\n\nThe throughput rate will mainly be controlled by the FSRU vessel by adjusting the delivery pressure into the pipeline. Further control may be applied by the land based facilities which are equipped with flow control valves and heating equipment.\n\nPort Meridian will be operational all year round.\n\nThe project has developed operating envelopes which forms the basis for selecting the FSRU size and correct pipeline diameter once the firm capacity has been set and agreed with customers.",

Uniper Global Commodities SE and the Dutch Vesta Terminals B.V. (“Vesta”) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to evaluate the feasibility of refurbishing and expanding an existing storage facility with the aim to create the first green ammonia hub ‘Greenpoint Valley’ in North-West Europe. Uniper intends to book capacity in the terminal to create an entry point into the Northwest European markets for the growing green Ammonia and Hydrogen activities within the Uniper group. Developing the green ammonia and hydrogen markets will also further strengthen security of supply in Europe.",

                "description": "The project includes a 1,000 km CO2 export trunkline operated by Equinor which will transport CO2 for safe and permanent storage under the seabed on the Norwegian continental shelf. The offshore trunkline will connect in Zeebrugge to an onshore CO2 transmission infrastructure built and operated by Fluxys. The open-access CO2 transmission system will give emitters in Belgium and surrounding countries the opportunity to connect to safe and reliable CO2 stores in Norway. As it goes, liquefied CO2 shipped from neighbouring hubs could be connected to the Zeebrugge facility, further increasing the geographical reach of the project. A pipeline branch to the port of Dunkirk is also envisaged and additional connections to other North-West European countries will be assessed as well.\n\nThe joint initiative by Equinor and Fluxys aims to develop the CO2 infrastructure project ready for commissioning before the end of this decade. The offshore pipeline is planned to have a transport capacity of 20 to 40 million tonnes of CO2 per annum, meeting an emerging need for CCS from multiple European industrial players. The project is in the feasibility stage, with an investment decision expected by 2025.",

This terminal and storage facility at the Port of Rotterdam will handle both clean ammonia and CO2. Redevelopment of several hectares for tank storage, multi-modal connections, and access to at least two deep-sea jetties will allow for multi-million tonnes of product throughput.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the two companies signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on the development of a terminal and storage facility at the Port of Rotterdam for clean ammonia produced and shipped from the clean ammonia plant Barents Blue. The agreement will have a wider scope going forward, and it now includes the intermediate storage of CO2 which will be permanently stored at Horisont Energi’s planned offshore storage facilities in Norway.",

                "description": "The project, named “Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub”, is set up as an open-access infrastructure to transport, liquefy and load CO2 onto ships for onward permanent offshore storage. CO2 captured on industrial players sites on the Antwerp port platform will be collected and transported via an intra-port open-access pipeline network. A shared liquefaction and export terminal will be built, including a CO2 liquefaction unit, buffer storages and marine loading facilities for cross-border shipping. This innovative project will be among the first and largest multimodal open access CO2 export facilities in the world.\n\nAs part of the project, Air Liquide and Fluxys intend to form a joint venture for the construction and operation of the CO2 liquefaction and export terminal. The joint venture will benefit from Air Liquide’s expertise in CO2 liquefaction and handling and from Fluxys’ experience in terminalling activities. Air Liquide will provide its proprietary technology for the CO2 liquefaction plant, which will be a first of a kind in its scale and design. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges reserved a plot of land for the terminal on a strategic location inside the port, and will build new quay infrastructures for the mooring of CO2 ships.\n\nThe project is the first phase of Antwerp@C, an initiative gathering Air Liquide, BASF, Borealis, ExxonMobil, INEOS, TotalEnergies, Fluxys and Port of Antwerp-Bruges with the ambition to halve the CO2 emissions in the Antwerp port area by 2030. In this first phase, Air Liquide and BASF will be the launching customers of the export hub through their joint CO2 capture and storage (CCS) project “Kairos@C”[1]. The Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub will have an initial export capacity of 2.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), with the ambition to reach up to 10 Mtpa by 2030. It will pave the way for future CCS initiatives in the region by providing scalable and modular infrastructures accessible to all industrial players.\n\nKairos@C is a joint Air Liquide and BASF project supported by the EU Innovation Fund that will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions at the BASF chemical site in Antwerp by 14 Mt of CO2 ​ over its first 10 years of operation.",
